# Arcade
Arcade Project in C++ with Pierre-Jean Descarpentries and Simon Auduberteau (My part: Core / SFML)


Project was to emulate an Arcade software with a few games and graphic libraries loading them dynamically
I made the Core in C++ 
Linux Compilable only, requires SDL and SFML as well as Ncurses
